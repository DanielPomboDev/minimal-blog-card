# Minimal Blog Card

![Minimal Blog Card Thumbnail](./thumbnail.jpg)

## Project Overview

This project is my solution to the [Minimal Blog Card challenge](https://devchallenges.io/). The objective was to recreate a clean, responsive blog card component using only HTML and CSS, closely following a provided design.

## What I Learned & Improved

### Responsive Web Design
I strengthened my understanding of responsive layouts by using media queries and flexible units. This helped me ensure the card adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

### CSS Flexbox & Spacing
I became more comfortable with Flexbox for aligning and distributing elements. I also learned to use gap, margin, and padding more intentionally to achieve balanced spacing and a visually pleasing layout.

### Semantic HTML
I focused on writing semantic HTML, using elements like `<article>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` to improve both accessibility and code structure.

### Custom Fonts & Color Palettes
I practiced importing and applying custom fonts from Google Fonts, and learned how to extract and use color values directly from a design reference.

### Image Optimization
I improved my workflow for optimizing images, ensuring they load quickly while maintaining quality.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Matching the Design:** Achieving pixel-perfect spacing and typography required careful attention to detail and some trial and error.
- **Responsiveness:** Making sure the card looked good on all devices was challenging but rewarding, and taught me the importance of testing across breakpoints.

## Conclusion

This project helped me reinforce my HTML and CSS fundamentals, especially in building responsive, accessible, and visually accurate components. I feel more confident in translating static designs into functional web elements and look forward to applying these skills to more complex projects.
